# binary_trees

### Tree traversal algorithms:

- `pre-order`: parent->left-child->right-child
- `in-order`: left-child->parent->right-child
- `post-order`: left-child->right-child->parent

### Terms

- `height` of a tree: the number of edges from the root to the farthest leaf
- `depth` of a tree: the distance from any node to the root node. That means height = max(list of depths)
- `size` of a tree: the total number of nodes of the tree
- `leaves`: nodes with no children
- `balance factor`: height of left subtree - height of right subtree
- `full` binary tree: if all nodes have two children, except the leaf nodes
